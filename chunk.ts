/**
 * Splits a long text into smaller chunks with overlap between them
 *
 * Why chunking is needed:
 * - AI models have limited "context windows" (can only process so much text at once)
 * - Overlap ensures context isn't lost between chunks
 * - Breaking at natural boundaries (paragraphs, sentences) preserves meaning
 *
 * @param text - The complete text to split into chunks
 * @param maxTokens - Maximum tokens per chunk (default: ~4,000 characters)
 * @param overlapTokens - How many tokens should overlap between chunks (default: ~400 characters)
 * @returns Array of text chunks with metadata
